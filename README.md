# Raja Thapa â€” Portfolio ðŸš€

This is my personal portfolio built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Itâ€™s not just a showcaseâ€”itâ€™s a declaration. Every section is intentional. Every scroll is rhythm. Every pixel is survival logic.

## ðŸ”¥ Why This Exists

I donâ€™t wait for permission. I architect presence.  
This portfolio is my outbound weaponâ€”designed to cut through noise, ghosting, and collapse.  
Built solo. Shipped under pressure. Tuned for recruiter-grade clarity.
